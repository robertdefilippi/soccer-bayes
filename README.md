# Estimating Poisson Distributions from Soccer Scores

![Title](https://github.com/robertdefilippi/traffic-bayes/blob/master/traffic_image.png?raw=true)

A short notebook on how to estimate Poisson Distributions using Bayesian methods.

All data was collected from [here](http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1617/E0.csv)

### Notebook

All work is stored in [bayes_soccer.ipynb](https://github.com/robertdefilippi/traffic-bayes/blob/master/traffic.ipynb) while a blog post was generated to go over the higher level aspects of the project.

The blog can be read [here](https://medium.com/@rrfd/bayesian-analysis-for-traffic-patterns-480e71a680ab).
